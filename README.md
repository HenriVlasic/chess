# chess

I want to play chess only with the text commands so that i can fix the squares in my head. And it will also make it easier to play blind chess.

I didn't find anywhere a place where I could play blind chess online, so I've decided to make my own "Blind Chess". There will be 2 options, first with the graphical
board so that you can see and get familiar with the name of the squares, and after you get familiar, you can just remove the graphical board and play just with the
commands.

(There is no chess engine to play against... YET!)

My program will not be focused on the graphical board, so probably I won't spend much time making it look good.
